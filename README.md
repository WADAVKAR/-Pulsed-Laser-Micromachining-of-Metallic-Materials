# -Pulsed-Laser-Micromachining-of-Metallic-Materials

"Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation."
Laser technology is at the core of the wider area of Machining Applications, essentially because laser light has a number of very special properties:

1. It is usually emitted as a well directed laser beam which can propagate over long lengths without much divergence and can be focused to very small spots, where a high intensity is achieved.
2. It may be emitted continuously, or alternatively in the form of short or ultrashort pulses, with durations from microseconds down to a few femtoseconds.
3. It can have a very narrow optical bandwidth, whereas e.g. most lamps emit light with a very broad optical spectrum.
4. The temporal concentration of energy – in addition to the potential of strong spatial confinement in a beam focus – allows for even far higher intensities to be generated.
